# Christoffer Mattsson Langseth

**Computational biologist** | **Spatial omics** | **Neuroinflammation** | **Mitochondria & metabolism** | **Exercise physiology**

Welcome! I am a postdoctoral researcher at **Karolinska Institutet**, where I combine advanced **spatial omics technologies** with questions in **neuroinflammation**, **mitochondrial biology**, and **metabolic adaptation**. My work aims to understand how cellular energy states shape disease trajectories—and how interventions such as **endurance exercise** can modulate CNS resilience.

My research spans several interconnected areas:

- **Spatially resolved omics**  
  High-resolution in situ technologies (10x Xenium, ISS, HybISS) to map cellular states, tissue remodeling, and inflammatory niches across space and time.

- **Mitochondrial dysfunction & bioenergetic stress**  
  Understanding how metabolic rewiring, lactate flux, and mitochondrial impairment contribute to lesion development, neurodegeneration, and adaptive responses.

- **Neuroinflammation & neuron–glia interactions**  
  Integrating large-scale spatial transcriptomics with single-cell RNA-seq and proteomics to dissect immune infiltration, glial activation, and tissue pathology in multiple sclerosis (MS) and experimental models (EAE).

- **Endurance exercise & CNS resilience**  
  Exploring how systemic metabolic stressors—such as endurance training—reshape CNS cell states, immune tone, mitochondrial function, and susceptibility to inflammatory injury.

I aim to bridge **experimental neuroimmunology**, **systems metabolism**, and **computational spatial biology** to develop a mechanistic framework for understanding CNS resilience and vulnerability.
